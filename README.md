# deep-learning

This repo includes all of the implementations for popular deep-learning techniques.

- [AlexNet](./alexnet.md)
- [ResNet](./resnet.md)

## Datasets

CIFAR-10, ImageNet, COCO, detection, COCO segmentation

## Cheat Sheets

1. SGD requires the gradients to be big enough such that it can run til the end.
2. Residual block is aiming for solving gradient vanishing/exploding problems.
